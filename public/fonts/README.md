# Nothing Font Placeholder

This directory should contain the Nothing font files.

## Download Instructions

1. Visit: https://github.com/xeji01/nothingfont
2. Download the font files
3. Place the following files in this directory:
   - NothingFont-Regular.woff2
   - NothingFont-Regular.woff
   - NothingFont-Bold.woff2
   - NothingFont-Bold.woff

## Note

If you cannot obtain the official Nothing font, the app will fall back to system fonts.
The design will still work, but it won't have the authentic Nothing UI aesthetic.

For development/testing, you can use any sans-serif font and rename it to match these filenames.
